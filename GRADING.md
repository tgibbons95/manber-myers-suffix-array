# Homework 2 Problem 4 Grading Feedback

# Student: Thomas Gibbons


** Correctness of Output (30%)

* Formatting

The repeat locations on the r-c strand are being printed in the wrong
order.

* BWT

Output matches.

* Repeats

Correct number of repeats.  I think they are correct, but it's hard to
check the indices because the ones on the r-c strand are being printed
in the wrong order (descending by starting point on fwd strand, not
ascending).

** Comments on Code (5%)

C++.  Looks good to me.

** README (5%)

Present and informative.
